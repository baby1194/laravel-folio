## Installation

Install using composer:

```
composer require nonoesp/folio:dev-master
```

Most packages will be auto-discovered by Laravel.

## Laravel

Next, add the new providers to the `providers` array of `config/app.php`:

```php
    'providers' => [
        // nonoesp/folio dependencies
        Conner\Tagging\Providers\TaggingServiceProvider::class,
        Thujohn\Twitter\TwitterServiceProvider::class,
    ],
```

Then, add the class aliases to the `aliases` array of `config/app.php`:

```php
    'aliases' => [
        // nonoesp/folio dependencies
        'Input' => Illuminate\Support\Facades\Input::class,
        'Markdown' => GrahamCampbell\Markdown\Facades\Markdown::class,
        'Twitter'   => Thujohn\Twitter\Facades\Twitter::class,
        'User' => 'App\User',		
    ],
```

[To authenticate, `Folio` uses `nonoesp/authenticate` (which should be already installed as a dependency).
But you need to follow the [Instructions to Install `nonoesp/authenticate`](https://github.com/nonoesp/laravel-authenticate/tree/master)]

## Middleware

For **Folio** translations to work properly we need to publish our `SetLocales.php` middleware, and install the `authenticate` middleware:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Folio\FolioServiceProvider" --tag=middleware
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Authenticate\AuthenticateServiceProvider" --tag=middleware
```

Then add the following to `app/Html/Kernel.php`:

```php
protected $middleware = [
        /// nonoesp/folio
        \App\Http\Middleware\SetLocales::class,
        /// nonoesp/authenticate
        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
        \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,			
        \App\Http\Middleware\RememberLogin::class,        
        /// ...
];

protected $routeMiddleware = [
        /// nonoesp/authenticate
        'login' => \App\Http\Middleware\RequireLogin::class,
        /// ...
];
```

A dependency of the authentication package of folio is `thujon/twitter`, so you will have to publish its config and add your Twitter credentials to `config/ttwitter.php` if you want to be able to log in with Twitter.

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Thujohn\Twitter\TwitterServiceProvider"
```

## Migrations

First, make sure you remove Laravel's default migration files from `database/migrations` as they can collide
with this package.

Let's create the tables required by **Folio** in your database.

First, make sure your database connection is setup properly in you `.env` file.

Publish `rtconner/tagging` migrations:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Conner\Tagging\Providers\TaggingServiceProvider"
```

Then, run the migrations:

```php
php artisan migrate
```

(You can always remove the tables by resetting: `php artisan migrate:reset`.
	But be *careful* as it will remove the contents of your tables.)

## Config

Publish configuration file to `config/folio.php`.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Folio\FolioServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

## Publish Assets

**Folio** ships with compiled CSS and JS assets, in case you want to use it as is,
they can be published as follows:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Folio\FolioServiceProvider" --tag=assets
```

## Publish Development Assets

If you want to customize and compile your own stylesheets,
**Folio** also contains SCSS files with numerous variables
you can tweak and development JavaScript files.
You just need to install a dependencies with `npm`,
publish the development assets,
and generate CSS and JavaScript with Laravel Mix.

Publish the development assets with:

If you haven't done so, publish `nonoesp/folio` development assets.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Folio\FolioServiceProvider" --tag=dev-assets
```

### Install Dependencies (with npm)

First, let's install all our asset dependencies (some of them are SCSS dependencies and others are JavaScript).

```bash
npm install nonoesp/core-scss bourbon font-awesome vue vue-resource vue-focus lodash jquery validate-js
```

### Compile Assets (with Laravel Mix)

Run `npm install` to make sure Laravel Mix is setup properly.

Your `webpack.mix.js` file should look like this.
(You can omit the `.js` or the `.sass` part, just keep whatever you are compiling.)

```php
let mix = require('laravel-mix');

// ...

mix.sass('resources/assets/sass/folio.scss', 'public/nonoesp/folio/css');
mix.js('resources/assets/js/folio.js', 'public/nonoesp/folio/js')
   .extract(['vue', 'vue-resource', 'vue-focus', 'jquery', 'validate-js', 'lodash', 'axios']);

```

## Customize Views

You can publish **Folio** views and customize them. (If you customize a few views and want to get updates from future version for others, you will need to remove the ones you haven't modify and re-publish the views of the package. This won't override your customized view, just the one you delete from your `resources/views/nonoesp/`.)

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nonoesp\Folio\FolioServiceProvider" --tag=views
```
